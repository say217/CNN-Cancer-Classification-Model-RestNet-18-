# Deep Learning Approach to Lung and Colon Cancer Detection in Histopathology Images Using ResNet-18

Cancer, particularly lung and colon cancer, remains a global health challenge, claiming millions of lives annually. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for improving patient outcomes, yet traditional histopathological analysis, which involves examining tissue samples under a microscope, is labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. The advent of deep learning offers a transformative solution by enabling automated, precise classification of medical images.  

This project leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the ResNet-18 architecture to classify histopathological images into lung or colon cancer categories. By employing transfer learning, data augmentation, and advanced optimization techniques, the model achieves high accuracy, demonstrating the potential of artificial intelligence to support pathologists in diagnostic workflows. This document provides a detailed explanation of the ResNet-18 model, its mathematical foundations, and the procedural steps undertaken, including dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation. The approach is grounded in rigorous mathematical principles and practical implementation, making it accessible to both researchers and practitioners in medical imaging and deep learning.
